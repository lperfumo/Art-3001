        <div class="container "><div class="one boxes:hover boxes" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> This week, I really enjoyed learning about Twine. It is interesting to see how these tools can be used alongside other applications. I am interested in seeing what it has to offer over just using the Visual Studio Code.</div>

My meditation is mostly a time I set aside for myself to get off my electronics because I have realized how many headaches I have in a week. I also planned on getting dinner with friends on the 9th but it was cut short due to the surprise storm that came out of no where. But, the hour I was outside on the oval was very lovely and relaxing. I appreciate everyone who brings their dogs to the oval to play since it puts a smile on my face!
