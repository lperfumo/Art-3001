        <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> This week was interesting to learn more about some of the errors I was having with my website. I hope to continue to work toward adding new things to my website. The discussion this week was interesting to think about the impact our data has and what it can be used for.  </div>

It always seems like a bunch of things seem to happen during this time in the semester. It is also strange to think how we would be in spring break during this time. It's interesting how the world had to find ways of coping with Covid by changing the schedule that has always been in place. I didn't realize that I didn't add the dumpling light image to my past post and I wanted to show a picture of my dog as well (I have especially been missing him this week).  <br>
