        <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> During class this week, I was able to complete all the elements I wanted to add to my website. Thanks to Dalena, I was also able to add a bubble animation that I didn't think was possible without JavaScript! I will be working on the responsiveness of my website during this upcoming week. Overall, I am happy with how the website looks. </div>

I was also able to meal prep for the week on Tuesday for the first time which really came in handy. Finally, I was able to find time to FaceTime friends from back home during the break since my schedule didn't intervene with theirs.   <br>
