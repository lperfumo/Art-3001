        <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> I am very glad to have seen everyone's project this week and the amount of progress everyone has made! I am excited to continue working to improve my website. The discussion this week was extremely interesting. It is crazy to think about how much technology has negatively effected our lives yet humans are the ones that caused it. I wondered how much this was out of convenience or just the lack of humans who can control it. </div>

We all enjoyed watching Ratatouille which is one of my fave Pixar movies. Wasn't able to do much else since I have been dealing with my health while trying to keep up with my class work. But it was great to find some time to relax this week! <br>
