        <div class="container "><div class="one boxes:hover boxes" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> This week, I finished up my Exercise 4. I tried to change certain elements that I didn't do well in the last exercises and add them in this exercise. Sadly, I was not able to make the website as interactive as I wanted it to be. I did present the other option to see what people thought but I am not sure what to do to make the website as interactive as I imagined. Going on, however, I realized I havenâ€™t created a website that scrolls down. I don't know why I keep on sticking to this style of website but it is easier for my mind to put all the elements together and I like the presentation. I am still proud of how the website looks but I hope to work on expanding my abilities when designing for the next project.</div>

It was great to make sure all the other things I needed to get done are either finished or almost finished. Although the weather wasn't necessarily the nicest during this break, I still took a little time to get out of my apartment to enjoy the outdoors! <br>
