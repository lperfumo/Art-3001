        <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> This week during class, I worked on exercise 4. I have been having some issues but I am putting everything I want into the website at the moment but I will try my best to add in everything. Although I did not get to present my section of the presentation, I really did enjoy this article. It really made me realize the lack of rules there are for the internet itself. Seeing how artists are being used for the benefit of brands just shows how much these brands abuse their power. </div>
            <div class="two"> <b><u>Things I need to improve on:</u></b><br><ul>
                <li>

                </li>

                    How to create good looking pop ups that don't cover the entire screen and don't take you to another page.

My aunt always told me that there is a time in the year were everyone has things break on them and things don't go well. Wondering if it is around this time since so many things have broken in my apartment in the span of four days.  <br>
