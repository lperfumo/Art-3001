   <h2 style="color: slateblue; text-transform: uppercase;">Week 3 Overview</h2>
   <p>It is <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder; color: plum;">interesting</span> to see how to  <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: #5ca2ff; text-transform: uppercase; text-shadow: 0 0 7px rgb(41, 169, 255);">customize</span> text.</p>

   <h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: rgb(224, 100, 79);">Discussion</h3>
<p style="font-size: large; text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgb(253, 173, 149);">Our discussion on Thursday gave me the opportunity to see the lack of resources the internet has for people with disabilities. As a student in the Disabilities Services here at OSU, <br>I have seen the many resources student are given to create an even playing field for all students. I have heard many times that these services are a luxury for students when, in <br>reality, it allows students with disabilities to have the same opportunities for success as others. In the same way, I think people underestimate how people who are deaf, blind or <br>hard of hearing can impact the internet. People don’t realize that putting in place a system to include those who are deaf, blind or hard of hearing shouldn’t be considered a luxury, <br>but rather a right that they have. It is important for them to have a voice in what needs to be done to make the internet accessible to everyone. Since social media has become such <br>an integral part of our lives, it should be a required field to describe the photo that you post and create close captions for videos. We should want everyone to feel included in our <br>conversations. I don’t necessarily blame those who don’t do this since, to be honest, I didn’t realize that this was a possibility. However, I think everyone should learn about how<br>people with disabilities are being excluded from content and change the way they post.  </p>

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: rgb(224, 100, 79);">Workshop</h3>
<p style="font-size: large; text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgb(253, 173, 149);">Our workshop on Thursday was a great way to understand some of the ways in which text can be manipulated through coding. I really enjoyed learning about how to seperate<br> paragraphs and section them off.  </p>

<p style="font-size: large; text-transform: uppercase ; text-shadow: 0 0 4px rgb(255, 94, 54);">Things I need to improve on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to use a text from Google fonts in my code.
        <ul>
            <li>Although I tried using the CSS style folder, it did not change the text font.</li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Have a better understanding of the differences between what CSS can do versus HTML. 
        <ul>
            <li>I could potentially create a chart of what each element does and what is needed to transform the text.</li>
        </ul>

<p>I played Jackbox games with some high school friends I haven't talked to in a while! It was great to enjoy some time doing an activity with friends! <br> It gave me a chance to take a break from school and the school environment. :)</p>
