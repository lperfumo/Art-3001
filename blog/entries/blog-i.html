        <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Class</u></b> <br> This week, I started to work on my exercise 4. It has been a little tricky to think about how to go about starting this exercise but I am excited by what I have. I also thought the movie "Feels Good Man" was a great tie in with the discussion on Thursday. The movie was honestly quite concerning. Personally, I never knew that Pepe was being used as a hate symbol until this film. It was scary and sad to see how powerless the artist was while this was all happening. It really brought awareness to the growing concern of reproducibility on the internet. An image can be manipulated and taken out of context which affects the owner of said image.   </div>

It is so refreshing to see more people outside and the weather getting warmer. The weather on Saint Patrick's Day brought me so much joy. I don't think I have been that positive since last year. Weather really has such a strong mental impact.  <br>
