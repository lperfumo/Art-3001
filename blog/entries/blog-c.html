    <div class="container"><div class="one" > <b><u>Discussion: Identity Online</u></b> <br> The internet is incorporated in every part of our daily life. Due to this, it is interesting to see the benefits and disadvantages of the internet. The podcast discussed how the internet can create connections but, in some cases, we don’t know how real these connections are. The internet also has a habit of not contextualizing and giving credit to where and what it was inspired from. Seeing how many of these trends online are using cultural appropriation yet is deemed to be acceptable in society (with no credit) just shows how damaged the internet is. Finally, the talk on censorship really made me think of all the ways people’s freedoms are being taken away from them when their voices are censored online all around the world.  </div>
        <div class="two"> <b><u>Class</u></b><br>This week, I learned about the different ways we can style our website. It will be interesting to see these styles added to our websites. I also learned a lot from exercise one. I made many mistakes while putting it together which means I learned a lot of what not to do. I also really liked seeing how other people interpreted the assignment. I thought that there would be less of a variation in what people created but I was absolutely wrong. I loved seeing the different elements people decided to incorporate and how they organized the pages. </div>
        <div class="three"><b><u>Things I need to improve on:</u></b>
            <ul>

                </li>
                <li>How to get the list dot and images to center.</li>

I never was too interested in gaming myself but I used to watch my older brothers play video games while growing up so I think that is where this interest for watching gaming videos originates from. It also lightens up the mood when I see how much I have to read for the week. <br>
        A video that made me laugh this week: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t48c99bpW_c&ab_channel=MichaelRokosh" target="_blank">fun video</a>
