    <h2>Could Silica Particles Save the Arctic Ice from Melting?</h2>
    <p>I recently watched a video from @the_zero_waste_teen on Instagram where scientist are testing how effective small specs of silica are at reflecting sun  </p>
    <p>from the surface of ice. This idea could potentially be a fantastic way to combat the effects from rising temperatures in the Arctic for the short term. These </p>
    <p>particles are able to float on the surface of the water but tests have shown so far that a small percentage has sunk. Since silica is an abundantly natural </p>
    <p>element on Earth, it shouldn’t have any effects of the animals who accidentally ingest it or to humans. However, there are doubts about negative impact it </p>
    <p>could have on the environment. In a BBC article, they discuss how the silica could block light from reaching organisms, such as plankton, that depend on </p>
    <p>sunlight. They also bring up the point that, even though the silica many not poison the organisms that consume it, the organism could believe that it is</p>
    <p>eating the nutrients it needs to survive when they aren’t. Personally, I was very excited to hear about this new possibility. Even though this idea isn’t a </p>
    <p>solution to the melting ice, it would be nice to know that we are starting to do something protect the Arctic ecosystem. However, after more research, </p>
    <p>I am becoming more skeptical about these short term solutions. I am always a little skeptical when it comes to humans bringing something into an </p>
    <p>environment. One example is when scientists introduced Cane Toads to an ecosystem hoping that it would solve their overpopulation of termites in the </p>
    <p>area. However, not only did the toads not help in lowering the termite population, they also began to destroy the ecosystem and kill the native frogs around </p>
    <p>them. The Cane Toads began to overpopulate and spread. Even though the silica particles in the Arctic isn’t quite the same circumstance, they both are </p>
    <p>an example of humans introducing something into an ecosystem which failed due to human impacts. Even though the supposed benefits outweigh the </p>
    <p>disadvantages, that doesn’t mean that the outcome will turn out tho be beneficial. In this case, I hope that, if the silica particles were distributed </p>
    <p>throughout the Arctic, they successfully prevent the rapid melting and keep the ecosystem safe. </p>
