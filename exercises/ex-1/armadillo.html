        As you walk through the passage, you realize that you are hungry. There is an amazing smell of food <br><br>as you get closer. You walk in to see a lot of baked goods around Roman. <br><br><br>
        "Hello neighbor. I hope you are finding your way through our burrow well. If you want to grab a bite <br><br>you are free to take anything you would like. As you can tell, I love eating sweet treats." <br><br><br>
        You take a crumb from what seems to be a muffin and head on your way. You can head to the<br><br> <a href="entrance.html">community burrow</a> to get directions. You can pop in to  <a href="raccoon.html">Elsie the raccoon</a>'s home and look around. <br><br>You can go visit <a href="rabbit.html">Evie the rabbit</a>'s home but it seems like she doesn't live in Napeteccas anymore. You<br><br> can head down to <a href="skunk.html">Finn the skunk</a>'s home to see how he are doing. You can go to <a href="prairie-dog.html">Willow the prairie dog</a>'s <br><br>home. You can go to chat with <a href="badger.html">Amara the badger</a>.
