        While walking through the passage, you feel as though you are stepping in pools of mud. <br><br><br>
        "Welcome. I am sorry for the mess. Since I take care of the construction here in the burrow, I am<br><br>always dragging more durt and mud into my home. It has been very busy here which I am sure<br><br> Willow has told you. If you want to make any changes to your home, you can just pass along the<br><br> message to Willow. We hope you feel comfortable and safe in your new home."<br><br><br>
        You thank Ember but you feel like she is too stressed to have a conversation at this moment. You<br><br> can go look into <a href="badger.html">Amora the badger</a>'s home. You can pass through to <a href="gopher.html">Ayden the gopher</a>'s home.
