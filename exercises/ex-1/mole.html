        As you walk in, you feel like you aren't in Napeteccas anymore. It is cold and dirty here. You can <br><br> hardly see anything. However, you heard something from far away. You are scared but also <br><br> curious why Sawyer's old home is like this. You notice something in the corner. You can head <br><br> over to the <a href="empty.html">corner</a> even though you are scared. You can go visit <a href="raccoon.html">Elsie the raccoon</a>'s home to get <br><br> away from the complete darkness. You can go to <a href="rabbit.html">Evie the rabbit</a>'s home which is closer to other <br><br> neighbors.
