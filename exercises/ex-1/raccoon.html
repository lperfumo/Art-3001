        As you pass through the tunnel you feel like you are intruding into a stranger's home. However,  <br><br> you see a picture of Elsie in the room and seem to recognize her. As you walk around, you hear  <br><br> something coming from the other side of the walls. You assume its from one of your neighbor's <br><br>homes. You become a little uncomfortable and realize that you should keep on moving forward.  <br><br> You can go back to the <a href="entrance.html">community burrow</a>. You can head to what used to be <a href="mole.html">Sawyer the mole</a>'s   <br><br>home. You can go see <a href="rabbit.html">Evie the rabbit</a>'s home which seems to be completely dark. You can visit  <br><br> <a href="armadillo.html">Roman the armadillo</a> in his home which smells tempting.
