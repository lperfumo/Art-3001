        "Hello. I hope the move to your new home was easy. I have a lot of food here so feel free to take<br><br> anything you would like. I normally collect food for the burrow. I know it isn't easy moving to a <br><br>new burrow so if there is anything I can do to take away any stress, just ask. It seems like a lot <br><br>of the neighbors are heading out quickly without a warning recently and we hope that they<br><br> didn't feel cut off from the community. We just want you to know that we hope you stay with<br><br> us and feel like you belong." <br><br><br>
