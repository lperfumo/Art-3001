        You pass through to Evie the Rabbit's old home. It is cold in the room. Evie seems to have <br><br> left some of her things during the move. You trip over what seems to be a twig but it's really <br><br> too dark to see anything very well. You become a little nervous and prefer to keep on  <br><br>moving. You can go to <a href="raccoon.html">Elsie the raccoon</a>'s home to check in. You can keep <a href="armadillo.html">Roman the armadillo</a>  <br><br>company. You can go to see <a href="skunk.html">Finn the skunk</a> since they are home. You can go into your <br><br> <a href="home.html">new home</a> to look around. You can go over to the empty home of <a href="mole.html">Sawyer the mole</a>.
