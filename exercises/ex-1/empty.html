        You realize that there is another empty room attached to Sawyer the mole's home. You go<br><br> in since you are intrigued but you feel like you have goosebumbs spreading all over your<br><br> body out of fear. You hear the sound become louder. You feel around the room and realize<br><br> that the wall across from the entrance is covered up with dirt and mud. You don't understand<br><br> why these homes are being covered up. You can dig your way through to the next abandoned<br><br> home to find out what the sound is. <br><br><br>Do you really want to <a href="getting-darker.html">continue</a>?<br><br> Or should you <a href="mole.html">go back</a>?
