    <p>You check the map and see that your home is located at the bottom of the town burrow. You <br><br>decide that you would add your name on the map later. <a href="entrance.html">You are excited to see your new home</a>. <br><br>Seems like you will have new neighbors soon too with all the openings. As you look to the right<br><br> of the bulletin board, you see a missing resident poster attached to the wall. You suspect that <br><br>Willow is taking care of the situation and the resident must have just gotten lost while finding <br><br>Napeteccas.</p>
