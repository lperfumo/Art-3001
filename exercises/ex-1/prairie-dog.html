        As you enter the room, you see just how frantic Willow must be with work. There are papers <br><br>and dirt lying everywhere. You pick up a couple papers off the floor. You wonder how much  <br><br> stress she must be dealing with. You decide that you will join the next community council  <br><br> meeting and volunteer to help out to take some pressure off of her hands. You can go check  <br><br> what kind of food <a href="armadillo.html">Roman the armadillo</a> has in his home. You can go talk to <a href="badger.html">Amora the badger</a> <br><br>about your new home. Your can go to <a href="gopher.html">Ayden the gopher</a>'s home. You can go to <a href="skunk.html">Finn the skunk</a>'s<br><br> inviting home.
