        You are happy with how the room looks but notice that you will have to take some time<br><br> to clean it up. There seems to be a draft coming from somewhere in the room so you will<br><br> probably have to get help on the issue when things calm down here in the burrow. You<br><br> put some of your things away. You are overwhelmed by the system here in Napeteccas but<br><br> know that this will feel like home very soon. You can stay and continue to unpack. You can<br><br> head over to <a href="rabbit.html">Evie the rabbit</a>'s which seems to be where the draft is coming from. You can go<br><br> to <a href="skunk.html">Finn the skunk</a>'s home which is inviting. You can go talk to <a href="gopher.html">Ayden the gopher</a>.
