        As you walk into Finn the skunk's home, you feel a sense of warmth that you have been<br><br> looking for. You feel relaxed. <br><br><br>
        "Hello there. I hope you are enjoying your new home. We all hope that you feel welcome <br><br>here. We all take up a role here in the Napeteccas burrow. I am known for taking care of <br><br>the young ones so let me know if I can ever help out." <br><br><br>
        You thank Finn for his kindness. Although you have a temptation to stay, you don't want <br><br>to intrude much longer. You can go to <a href="armadillo.html">Roman the armadillo</a>'s home. You can go to<br><br> <a href="prairie-dog.html">Willow the prairie dog</a>'s home to see if she has returned. You can go into your <a href="home.html">new home</a>.<br><br> You can go to <a href="rabbit.html">Evie the rabbit</a>'s old home which looks pitch black compared to Finn's home.
